** Wordlick: Mobile optimized Sinatra app for solving/generating words for Hanging With Friends

To run locally:
git clone -o origin git@github.com:DiegoSalazar/Wordlick.git
cd wordlick
ruby wordlick.rb
go to localhost:4567

***************************************************************
Notes: The word finding regex needs improvement. 
	For example: if we submit "e-e--" we shouldn't see a result that contains more than 2 "e" since we're looking for a word that only has 2 "e"
